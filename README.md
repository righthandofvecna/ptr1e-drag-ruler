# PTR1e Drag Ruler Integration
A Foundry VTT module that aims to enhance the Drag Ruler module for use with the PTR 1e system. This includes tokens being able to easily and quickly change between their different types of movement speed (swimming, flying, burrowing, etc) and an 'automatic' movement setting to streamline your encounter setups.
As the MIT license suggests, feel free (and encouraged) to copy and adapt my code to work with any other rpg system.
